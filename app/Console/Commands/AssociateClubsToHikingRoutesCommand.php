This command retrieves all existing clubs and iterates through each one. For each club, it searches for the corresponding hiking route using the "source_ref" field. If a matching hiking route is found, the club is associated with the hiking route.

To ensure successful synchronization, verify that the "HikingRoute" and "Club" models have the appropriate "source_ref" and "cai_code" fields defined and that they are consistent with each other.
